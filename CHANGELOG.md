## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-10

Mode 4 (`/sdlc improve`), strict git branching discipline across all modes, HANDOFF block overhaul, and Bounded Task Mode on all specialist agents.

### Added

- **Mode 4 (`/sdlc improve ["<focus>"]`)** — New SDLC mode for discovery-driven improvement of existing systems. Runs targeted specialist audits (UX, code quality, performance, security, DB), synthesizes findings into a prioritized improvement backlog (S/M/L sizing), and executes approved items with the right ceremony for their size (S = direct + verify, M = design step first, L = spawn Mode 3 sub-workflow). Optional focus arg narrows scope: `"ux"`, `"performance"`, `"security"`, `"code-quality"`.
- **Git Discipline section (mandatory — all modes)** — New top-level section defining the branching model: `main` = production, no direct commits. Each mode now creates a typed branch before touching any file: `sdlc/setup` (Mode 1 phases 0–3), `docs/onboard` (Mode 2), `feat/[slug]` (Mode 3), `improve/[slug]` (Mode 4). Every mode ends with a PR — no work merges without one.
- **`sdlc/setup` branch for Mode 1** — Phases 0–3 design docs all commit to `sdlc/setup`, not `main`. After Phase 3 gate passes, the branch is merged to `main` via PR before Phase 4 implementation begins. Feature branches cut from updated `main`.
- **Mode 2 branch + PR** — `docs/onboard` branch created at Step 0. All onboarding docs committed there. PR opened at end — docs don't land on `main` without review.
- **Mode 3 explicit merge step** — After all reviews pass in Step 4, `git-expert` marks the draft PR as ready and squash-merges to `main`. Branch deleted after merge.
- **Mode 4 branch + PR** — `improve/[slug]` branch created at Step 1 before any audit work. All findings and implementation committed there. PR opened at wrap-up.
- **Bounded Task Mode on all 11 specialist agents** — `SDLC-TASK for [agent]:` prefix triggers a scoped execution mode: skip discovery, skip orchestrator phases, read only the files listed under CONTEXT, execute exactly the task in YOUR TASK, write exactly the files in PRODUCE, print the exact completion phrase, then stop. Prevents specialists from running full multi-phase workflows when invoked via HANDOFF.
- **SDLC-TASK HANDOFF format on all 33 delegation points** — Every specialist HANDOFF in `sdlc-lead` now uses the structured `SDLC-TASK for [agent]: CONTEXT / YOUR TASK / PRODUCE / completion phrase` format. Specialists execute bounded jobs without triggering their own orchestrator workflows.
- **Mode 4 Improvement Discovery Interview** — Structured interview determines which audits to run based on what's driving the improvement (user complaints, perf concerns, tech debt, security, etc.). Announces audit plan and waits for user confirmation before running any specialists.

### Changed

- **`sdlc-lead` description** updated to include Mode 4 (`/sdlc improve`).
- **`sdlc-lead` command table** updated from "Three Operating Modes" to "Four Operating Modes".
- **All Phase 0–3 git commits** now explicitly target `sdlc/setup` branch (not "current branch").
- **`sdlc-lead` Rules** — Three new rules: never commit to `main` directly, always create the mode's branch before starting, always open a PR before merging.
- **All specialist agents** changed from `mode: "subagent"` to `mode: "primary"` — fix for OpenCode 1.4.0 which hides `subagent`-mode agents from direct invocation. All 12 agents now visible in the UI.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-10

Multi-agent orchestration, real-time progress feedback, phase-splitting for long-running agents, full git and UX wiring throughout the SDLC, and a comprehensive test suite.

### Added

- **Researcher orchestrator + `--single` + `--plan` modes** — The `researcher` agent no longer runs as one silent multi-minute block. In orchestrator mode (default) it announces its plan, spawns a `--single` sub-task per question via the `task` tool, and reports each finding as it completes (`✓ Q1: ...`). `--single` researches exactly one question in 30–60 s. `--plan` returns a question list only.
- **Orchestrator + `--phase: N` mode on all 8 long-running agents** — `db-architect`, `test-engineer`, `sre-engineer`, `container-ops`, `performance-engineer`, `api-designer`, `security-auditor`, `code-reviewer` all gained the same two-mode pattern. Orchestrator announces a phase plan, spawns one sub-task per phase (each writes to `docs/work/<agent>/<slug>/phaseN.md`), reports `✓ Phase N: [finding]` after each. `--phase: N name` runs only that phase in under 90 s.
- **Progress announcements mandatory on all 10 agents** — Every agent now has a `## Progress Announcements` section requiring `▶ Phase N: [name]...` at start and `✓ Phase N complete: [summary]` at end of every phase. These surface in the `task` tool's UI label via `context.metadata`.
- **Real-time metadata on every assistant message** — `task.ts` fires `context.metadata` on every JSON event from stdout, not just on the 5 s heartbeat.
- **`scripts/test.ts`** — Comprehensive test suite replacing `validate-tools.js`. Three passes: (1) dynamically imports each `.ts` tool via Node 24 native TS, validates runtime shape; (2) parses skill frontmatter, validates name/description/agent cross-references; (3) checks agent content length and role/identity.
- **`scripts/add-orchestrator.mjs`** — Script to insert the orchestrator + phase-mode block into new agents.
- **`mode: "subagent"` frontmatter on all 11 specialist agents** — Correct classification for OpenCode native task tool when custom agent support ships. `sdlc-lead` gets `mode: "primary"`.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 2: git history inspection (Step 0)** — `git-expert --inspect` runs before any code is read; hot files and recent activity focus landscape mapping.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 2: UI detection** — Step 1 detects UI frameworks/directories, records `UI-bearing: YES/NO`.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 2: UX audit** — If UI-bearing, Step 6 calls `ux-engineer --audit`.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 2: docs commit** — Step 7 calls `git-expert` to commit all produced onboarding docs.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 1: git checkpoints after phases 0–3** — `git-expert` commits phase docs after each gate. Nothing advances uncommitted.
- **`sdlc-lead` Mode 3: UX review in implementation** — Step 3 calls `ux-engineer --review` after code review for UI features; CRITICAL/HIGH block the PR. Step 4 adds accessibility audit. Step 5 updates `UX_SPEC.md` and commits docs.
- **`sdlc-lead` Phase 3/4/5: explicit `task()` calls with timeouts** — All delegations now have concrete `task(agent=..., prompt=..., timeout=...)` blocks sized for orchestrator depth (480–720 s).

### Changed

- **`task.ts` max timeout 600 s → 900 s** — 6 phases × 120 s = 720 s; new cap provides headroom.
- **`task.ts` default timeout 120 s → 180 s**.
- **`tools/grep-mcp.ts`** — Fixed `require('child_process')` in ESM module; replaced with `import { exec as execCb }`.
- **`package.json`** — `"type": "module"`, test script uses `node --experimental-strip-types`.
- **`sdlc-lead` researcher calls include numbered questions** — All three research delegations provide explicit questions so orchestrator mode activates without a planning round-trip.

### Architecture note

The `task` tool spawns `opencode run --agent X --format json` as a subprocess — the correct workaround for the current OpenCode limitation where the built-in task tool only supports `general` and `explore` (custom agents not yet supported: [anomalyco/opencode#20059](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/20059)). When OpenCode ships full custom agent support, switching to the native task tool will give proper child-session visibility in the TUI sidebar without needing `context.metadata` hacks.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-10

Major upgrade wave: new `git-expert` agent, three-mode `code-reviewer` rewrite, three-mode `ux-engineer` rewrite, deeper `security-auditor`, sdlc-lead discovery interviews, asymmetric confidence gates applied across every agent. Repository cleanup + new documentation.

### Added
- **`git-expert`** — New 6-mode agent (`--init`, `--feature`, `--release`, `--recover`, `--inspect`, `--sync`). Handles repo bootstrap, daily feature-branch flow with atomic commits and draft PRs, semver releases with Keep-a-Changelog, reflog-based recovery, history forensics (blame / pickaxe / bisect), and multi-remote sync (Gitea + GitHub). Includes secret-scanning, reflog backups before destructive ops, and explicit confirmation gates. Wired into `sdlc-lead` at Phase 0, Phase 4, Phase 5, and Mode 3.
- **`references/git-workflow-checklist.md`** — Canonical rules for conventional commits, SemVer 2.0, Keep-a-Changelog, language-aware `.gitignore` presets, recovery scenarios, report templates, and destructive-op confirmation templates.
- **`code-reviewer` four modes** — `--review` (7-dimension health pass), `--debt` (leverage-sorted tech-debt register), `--consolidate` (DRY + error-handling consolidation with Consolidation Catalog), `--patterns` (cross-codebase drift audit).
- **`references/code-health-checklist.md`** — 7 dimensions, silent-failure hunter, consolidation catalog, language thresholds, confidence scoring, report templates.
- **`ux-engineer` three modes** — `--design` (WCAG-aware component design), `--review` (Nielsen Norman heuristic pass), `--audit` (accessibility audit with live-environment methodology).
- **Discovery Interviews + Confidence Loops** on `sdlc-lead` — Mode 1 and Mode 3 now start with a mandatory interview protocol; every phase ends with a per-document confidence gate (asymmetric: < 5 = fail, 5-6 = revise max 3x, ≥ 7 = pass).
- **Inter-Phase Check-In + Research Findings Review protocols** — Prevents `sdlc-lead` from auto-advancing phases and forces it to reconcile research with prior decisions.
- **Semgrep deep upgrade** — Community rules integration, framework auto-detect, two-tier scans in `security-auditor`.
- **Skeleton-first security report format** — Rewritten to surface actionable intel first.
- **Verifier isolation + reader simulation + asymmetric gates** — Applied across all 12 agents.
- **MemPalace MCP integration** — Persistent memory for OpenCode workflows.
- Repository cleanup: `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, shortened `README.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `docs/USERGUIDE.md`.

### Changed
- **`sdlc-lead` Phase 0 now calls `git-expert --init` first** — so VISION.md is the first tracked artifact.
- **`sdlc-lead` Phase 4 calls `git-expert --feature`** per completed feature for branch + atomic commits + draft PR.
- **`sdlc-lead` Phase 5 calls `git-expert --release`** once reviews pass — semver bump + signed tag + GitHub/Gitea releases.
- Agent descriptions now use trigger-aware "pushy" language so they surface proactively.
- OpenCode-specific compatibility fixes and session-context tooling.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-09

End-of-day state after a major expert-depth push. 11 experts upgraded with real per-phase iteration loops, instinct patterns, deep threat modeling, verbatim code snippet enforcement, and a Mode 2 (`sdlc onboard`) overhaul with high-level architecture + operation sequence diagrams.

### Added
- **Real expert behavior** across all 11 agents — per-phase iteration, instinct patterns, deeper threat modeling.
- **Semgrep integration** in `security-auditor` — auto-install, auto-detect language, guided setup.
- **Context7 MCP** — Live library documentation lookup reference available to all agents.
- **Custom OpenCode tools** — `tools/` directory with 18 TypeScript tools (bash, grep-mcp, write, append, update, file-info, task, test-runner, playwright-test, playwright-web, semgrep-scan, semgrep-rule, simplify-file, pomodoro, run, log-parser, loop-detector, deploy).
- **Micro-loop pattern** applied to all 11 agents (ThreatForge lessons absorbed).
- **Detailed security + code review reports** — verbatim code quotes, concrete exploitation explanations, file:line anchors.
- **Mode 2 (`sdlc onboard`) overhaul** — high-level architecture pass, operation sequence diagrams, confidence loop.
- Local LLM compatibility fixes across all 11 agents.

### Changed
- Phase agents consolidated into a single `sdlc-lead` program manager with 3 operating modes (init, onboard, feature).
- Install script (`install.sh`) hardened: idempotent clean-reinstall, safely merges Context7 MCP into existing `opencode.json`, checks for Semgrep.
- Agent directory structure + frontmatter fixed for OpenCode compatibility.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-06
